# Ravelin Front-End Code Test

![mock](https://github.com/unravelin/fe-code-test/blob/master/mock.png?raw=true)

## Summary

We've designed a fake homepage for [ravelin.com](https://www.ravelin.com/). Your task is to build this homepage in HTML + CSS.

We would encourage you to try and match the design as closely as possible, outside of that there's no right or wrong way to build this. Get creative, go ahead and make it responsive if you want, feel free to use CSS frameworks, or don't â€” it's completely up to you.

You can access the design file [here](https://www.figma.com/file/suFt9XnKDnSKWe2VfGfIAx/Ravelin-Website-Code-Test?node-id=0%3A1). You are required to [sign up to Figma](https://www.figma.com/signup) to "inspect" the design file which gives you access to colours, spacing, and typography used in the design.

The font used throughout is SF Mono and can be downloaded [here](https://developer.apple.com/fonts/).

Other assets have been included in the repository.
